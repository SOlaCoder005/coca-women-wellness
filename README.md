## Section 1: Overview 

This repository is for Portfolio 1: HTML & CSS project which is part of the Full Stack Software Development Diploma (5P) with the Code Institute (CI). 

#### Portfolio Chosen

Out of several project briefs presented, Project Example Idea 0 was chosen as the project asked the designer to ‘…bring your own ideas to life…” through the creation of a website.  To provide more conceptual structure to the project, the Coca Women Wellness (CWW) website uses the concepts presented in Project Idea Example 3 as a point of reference.  

Akin to the objectives in example 3, the Coca Women’s Wellness (CWW) website aims to attract users that seek to access artefacts and resources (e.g. videos, recipes, social activities) aimed to bolster and teach _”...body/mind self-improvement techniques’_.

#### Coca Women Wellness - the website

The CWW site aims to develop users’ mindful practices (e.g. yoga, meditation etc.) which can help to boost overall wellbeing. The website hosts several digital mediums to reach this goal (e.g. videos on physical exercise, mindful practices, recipes, music, social activities and even meditations techniques). Such resources have been included on the site to reflect the feedback gained from users’ stories. Such stories were gathered at the early stages of website development and shall be expanded on in later sections of this file. 

#### Mindfulness vs. Wellbeing: Semantic meaning 

While the terms _‘wellbeing’_  and  _‘mindfulness’_ are often used interchangeably. It is worth noting that wellbeing is considered a _‘… broad concept…relating to…personal dignity (including treatment of the individual with respect)…, physical and mental health and emotional wellbeing,.. social and economic wellbeing. To summarise, ‘…Wellbeing encompasses several areas of life.'.  As such, it is a growing consensus that _‘…using a holistic approach to ensure a clear understanding of the individual’s views is vital to identifying and defining wellbeing in each case.”_ (Hpft.nhs.uk., 2021).

Similarly, mindfulness is characterised as _“…the practice of maintaining a non-judgmental state of heightened or complete awareness of one's thoughts, emotions, or experiences on a moment-to-moment basis.”_  (Merriam-Webster.com, 2021).
With these definitions in mind, rather than being interchangeable, wellbeing and mindfulness can be regarded as adjoining concepts, where developing mindful practices (in whatever area of life) is likely to positively impact overall wellbeing.


## Section 2: User Design (UX) 

### 2.1 UX Design – The User and User experiences 

#### The User: The target audience

Given the negative impact that current sociocultural and social-economic issues have had on society (e.g. COVID-19 and continued social inequality), there has been increased discourse on raising awareness around, and providing greater support for improving people’s wellbeing. Further, there has been an increased volume of socio-economic initiatives that aim to bolster the mental, social, and emotional wellbeing of minority groups, particularly those in the African and/or Caribbean diaspora. Considering this, CWW offers primary and secondary wellbeing media and resources (e.g. images, videos, tutorials, influencers, and recipes) curated by, and for, communities of the African/Caribbean diaspora. 
 
#### The User: Key Demographic(s)

The term demographics relates to the characteristics of a population and the specific groups within it. Given the proposal, CWW focuses on women’s wellbeing. The key demographic factors considered when forming CWW were sex, age and ethnicity. In more detail the demographical factors the site intends to target are women between the ages of 16-40 of African/Caribbean ethnicity.  

#### The User: Type 

Given the nature of the site and the feedback gained from the user stories – it is suggestive that the primary end-users that would visit this site are women of African and/or Caribbean heritage. 

#### The User: User Stories

Prior to creating the website, some market research was conducted to gain insight into the potential expectations that the target audience has when visiting sites that offer content and resources around mindfulness and/or wellbeing. As such, several women were asked  the following questions:

1.	Do you visit any wellbeing sites/apps? If so could provide some names?
2.	Do you follow any black female wellbeing influencers?
3.	Do you think wellbeing content created by and for black women would help support your wellbeing?
4.	If you were looking at a wellbeing site designed to promote the wellbeing of black women - what type of content would you like to see? 
5.	How do you prefer wellbeing topics/content to be presented to you (e.g. via blogs, videos, images, courses, or books)?

#### The User: Desired Goals - what do the users want to achieve? 

Based on the questions listed above and the users’ [feedback]( https://github.com/SOlaCoder005/coca-women-wellness/blob/93c3d7b03878c346b075efd8e5690c09955af063/docs/charts-and-graphs/enduserstories.PNG);  the users’ salient goal when visiting the site is to engage with visual and written content that develops and positively impacts multiple facets of their wellbeing. From the users’ stories, such facets include, but are not limited to; meditation practices, relationship content, hair and ‘healthy’ food recipes. As such, the CWW site inherently focus on such topics, through the lens of African/Caribbean culture. 

### 2.2 UX Design – Website value 

#### Valuableness of the website 

The Coca Women Wellness website provides serves two key purposes that increases its value: 
(1) The site intends to bolster users’ wellbeing through exposure to wellbeing influencers and resources primarily sourced from the African/Caribbean diaspora. Based on some excerpts from the users’ stories – several women had limited knowledge of well-being influencers, specifically those of African and/or Caribbean decent. Lack of exposure of such influencers in media has been a prevalent issue that is being addressed in the current social climate. It has led to the implementation of inclusion and diversity initiatives in media such as [#YouTubeBlack](https://www.youtube.com/intl/ALL_za/creators/ytbvoicesfund/). 

(2) The website provides a free, contemporary way of distributing information by presenting non-literary approaches to accessing wellbeing content. Furthermore, Mintel reports have indicated that the growth of digital resources and platforms have encouraged people to engage with more visual content, specifically on digital devices like laptops and smartphones (McGrath, 2020).  Moreover, visual content (e.g. films, art, images etc.) has greater engagement from those aged people aged 16-44. Such findings echo trend reports’ assertions that around 26% of UK adults are likely to engage in traditional reading (e.g. hardcover books) (Ryan, 2020). 
With this in my CWW intends to both bolster users’ exposure to digital content and resources that helps develop positive mindfulness practices which will likely promote overall wellbeing. A secondary initiative for the website is to expose users to influencers that curate content around this subject matter – wellbeing, with the African/Caribbean diaspora in mind.  
 

#### Competitors: How does CWW differs competitors?

Arguably, a lot of wellbeing and mindfulness websites portray a clinical narrative which is often reflected in their content (e.g. aesthetical design) and services (e.g. therapeutic services and treatment). For instance, sites such as [Rethink Mental Illness]( https://www.rethink.org/advice-and-information/living-with-mental-illness/wellbeing-physical-health/black-asian-and-minority-ethnic-mental-health/) offer clinical services such as counselling and priced therapeutic materials (e.g. meditation courses, books). Moreover, a Google search of the phrase ‘black wellbeing’ presented a list of wide range of articles and resources written in extremely formal tones. 

While these resources are appropriate and invaluable to addressing and supporting matters around wellbeing, CWW has been designed with a more informal tone. Specifically, CWW presents aspires to host wellbeing resources through a more informal relaxed tone, reflecting websites such as [World Changer Life]( https://www.worldchangerlife.com/), [Kwanda]( https://kwanda.co/), [Black Zen](https://www.blackzen.co/#services-and-more) and [Black Women Healing Retreats]( https://www.blackwomenhealingretreats.com/about-black-women-healing-retreats.html).  
 

### 2.3 UX Design - Development 

#### Development: Planning the website using the Strategy Plane and User Stories

Based on the users’ feedback, and implementing some methods outlined in UX Design’s 5 Planes model; a [matrix]( https://github.com/SOlaCoder005/coca-women-wellness/blob/87aae1964f9cf4c8f7e7d118db7e51870c817589/docs/charts-and-graphs/strategyplane-matrix.PNG) was made to identify and rank the 5 key [deliverables]( https://github.com/SOlaCoder005/coca-women-wellness/blob/e7ae1506f253f050498deeae2b2e13b4c218ba80/docs/charts-and-graphs/strategyplane-table.PNG) of the CWW website. In more detail: 

- The deliverables were valued by perceived importance, viability, and feasibility. 

- The analysis of the matrix indicated that the following deliverables were the most salient, ranking on a scale of 1-5, from highest to lowest importance respectively:

1.	Provide resources that helps users learn mindful, wellbeing and self-improvement techniques. (a)
2.	Create a functional website with easy navigation. (d)
3.	Provide resources that promote well-being of African Diaspora Women (b)
4.	Promote African Diaspora wellbeing content creators (c)
5.	Increase user interaction across social media platforms (e)


#### Development: Wireframes and other Design Documents

Below are links to serval documents that have supported the conceptualisation and implementation of designing the CWW website. The content ranges from wireframes, mood bards, tables, matrix charts, and even existing websites that has inspired the create of CWW (e.g. colour themes for the website). 

#### Wireframes 
The wireframes depict the preliminary concept for the CWW website design and have been grouped by page and device type. The structure and appearance of the live CWW website varies considerably from the preliminary wireframes. The contributing factors for these difference has been documented in the [testing document](https://github.com/SOlaCoder005/coca-women-wellness/blob/a5c2068f53f901115928df67ad9651ef0c35415e/docs/testing/TESTING.md) within the current readme and repository. Although the final structure of the site differs considerably to the preliminary wireframes; the CWW responds to different device parameters and hence screen sizes (incl. Desktop, mobile and tablet screens).

#### Design: Moodboards and Diagrams

As part of the preliminary conceptualisation of the CWW website, the designer chose to research some popular wellbeing websites that depicted common cultural characteristics within different communities of the African/Caribbean diaspora. Below are links to the moodboards and documents that helped to direct the design process and rationale behind the website: 

<img src="/docs/colour-theme/cww-website-colourtheme.png">

#### Design: Colour Theme Rationale 

Keeping cultural characteristics in mind, a combination of brown and other warm hues were incorporated into the colour scheme CWW. For instance, the conscious decision to apply yellow as the primary colour scheme of the homepage was linked to the strong social-cultural, semantic, and symbolic meaning it conveys within several African/Caribbean communities. 


<img src="/assets/images/CWW-live-home-header.PNG">


Arguably many of these cultures have assigned positive connotations to the colour yellow. For instance, concepts around wealth, femininity and fertility in some African cultures are often illustrated with yellow aspects, this can be incorporated into garment colour schemes and even religious characterisations. For instance, the Yoruba Orisha – Oshun has been often been drawn wearing yellow garments (Britannica.com, 2021).  Similarly, within the Caribbean, specifically Rastafarian cultures, the colour yellow has been included in their native attire and artefacts. Yellow in this culture is used to signify wealth and prosperity (BBC.co.uk, 2009).  

The other colours throughout the site were sourced from the primary left-hand images displayed on each of the website’s pages. Each colour had their opacity levels altered throughout the website (e.g. in :hover functions) in order to convey visual depth in each page. The primary colours used across the pages are listed below: 

- Yellow: rgb(255, 215, 0)
- Orange: rgb(255, 165, 0)
- Burgundy/Brown: rgb(62, 13, 5)
- Pink: rgb(253, 139, 196)
- Cream: rgb(253, 239, 160)
- Electric Blue: rgb(63, 25, 202)

#### Design: Fonts 

The fonts used on the CWW site were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and were used on the website for the following reasons: 

- **Oswald**: This is a considerably ‘weighted’ sans-serif font. It was used on the header sections to ensure that the navigation titles remained prominent across the varying header colours.

- **Open Sans**: Aside from the header, this font was used throughout the site. It was chosen to compliment the ‘feminine’ theme of the site. Arguably, round shapes are often associated with feminine characteristics. As such, the rounded characteristics of this font conveys a softer tone to the overall page compared to the Oswald font and vibrant colours used.

## Section 5: JQuery

The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Section 6: Testing
    In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

    Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

    For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

## Section 7: Contact form
    Go to the "Contact Us" page
    Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
    In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

    You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

    If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Section 8: Deployment

    This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

    In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

    Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
    Different configuration files?
    Separate git branch?
    In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
