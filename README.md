## Section 1: Overview 

This repo is for Portfolio 1: HTML & CSS project which is part of the Full Stack Software Development Diploma (5P) with the Code Institute (CI). 

#### Portfolio Chosen

Out of several project briefs presented, I chose to Project Example Idea 0. As the project asked that the designer (me) ‘…bring your own ideas to life…” through the creation of a website.  To provide more conceptual structure to the project, the CWW website loosely reflects the project objectives presented in Project Example 3.  

Akin to the objectives in example 3, the Coca Women’s Wellness (CWW) website is  for users that are looking to access artefacts and resources (e.g. videos, recipes, social activities) that help bolster and teach _”...body/mind self-improvement techniques’_.

#### Mindfulness vs. Wellbeing: Semantic meaning 

Arguably, the terms _‘wellbeing’_  and  _‘mindfulness’_ are often used interchangeably, it is worth noting that wellbeing is considered a _‘… broad concept…relating to…personal dignity (including treatment of the individual with respect)…, physical and mental health and emotional wellbeing,.. social and economic wellbeing… Wellbeing encompasses several areas of life.”.  It is a common consensus that _‘…using a holistic approach to ensure a clear understanding of the individual’s views is vital to identifying and defining wellbeing in each case.”_ (Hpft.nhs.uk., 2021).

Similarly, mindfulness is characterised as _“…the practice of maintaining a non-judgmental state of heightened or complete awareness of one's thoughts, emotions, or experiences on a moment-to-moment basis.”_  (Merriam-Webster.com, 2021).

With these definitions in mind, rather than being interchangeable, wellbeing and mindfulness are adjoining concepts, where developing mindful practices (in whatever area of life) is likely to positively impact overall wellbeing. In more detail, the CWW site aims to develop users’ mindful practices (e.g. yoga, meditation etc.) which can help to boost overall wellbeing. Ideally, the website will provide digital mediums to reach this goal will include (videos on physical exercise, mindful practices, recipes, music, social activities and even meditations techniques). Such resources have been choosing to be included on the site to reflect the feedback from the users’ stories. Such stories were gathered at the early stages of website development. This shall be expanded on in later sections of this file. 

## Section 2: User Design (UX) 

### 2.1 UX Design – The User and User experiences 

#### The User: The target audience

Given the negative impact that current sociocultural and social-economic issues have had on society (e.g. COVID-19 and continued social inequality), there has been increased discourse around raising awareness of, and providing greater support to, improving people’s wellbeing. Further, there has been an increased volume of socio-economic initiatives that aim to bolster the mental, social, and emotional wellbeing of minority groups, particularly those in the African and/or Caribbean diaspora. Considering this, my website shall offer primary and secondary wellbeing media and resources (e.g. images, videos, tutorials, influencers, and recipes) curated by, and for, communities of the African/Caribbean diaspora. 
 
#### The User: Key demographic(s)

The term demographics relates to thew characteristics of a population and the specific groups within it. Given the proposal, I will be focusing on women’s wellbeing. The key demographic factors considered when forming CWW were sex, age and ethnicity. In more detail the demographical factors the site intends to target are women between the ages of 16-40 of African/Caribbean ethnicity. 

#### The User: User Stories

Prior to creating the website, I conducted some market research to gain insight into the potential expectations that the target audience would have when visiting wellbeing sites that offer content and resources around mindfulness. As such I asked several women the following questions:

1.	Do you visit any wellbeing sites/apps? If so could provide some names?
2.	Do you follow any black female wellbeing influencers?
3.	Do you think wellbeing content created by and created for black women would help support your wellbeing?
4.	If you were looking at a well-being site designed to promote the well-being of black women - what type of content would you like to see? 
5.	How would you like wellbeing topics/content to be presented to you (e.g. via blogs, videos, images, courses, or books)?

#### User expectations and compelling experiences 

In response to the questions listed above, the users interviewed provided the following feedback. I have no include the name of those interviewed to keep their identity private. 

<img src="/docs/charts-and-graphs/enduserstories.PNG">

#### The User: Type 

Given the nature of the site and the feedback I have gained from the user stories – it is suggestive that the primary end-users users of this site are women of African and/or Caribbean heritage, the primary target audience.

#### The User: Desired Goals - what it is that they want to achieve 

The perceived goal(s) of the users seems to be engaging with visual and written content that will develop and positively impact multiple facets of their well-being of women. From the user’s stories such facets include, but are not limited to, meditation practices, relationship content, hair. As such, the nature of the site will intend to focus on common narratives relevant to African/Caribbean culture. 

### 2.2 UX Design – Website value 

#### Valuableness of the website 

I believe the site will be a valuable digital resource for two key reasons: 
(1) The site intends to bolster users’ wellbeing through exposure to wellbeing influencers and resources primarily sourced from the African/Caribbean diaspora. Based on some excerpts from the users’ stories – several women had limited knowledge of well-being influencers, specifically those of African and/or Caribbean decent. Lack of exposure of such influencers in media has been a prevalent issue that is being addressed in the current social climate. It has led to the implementation of inclusion and diversity initiatives in media such as [#YouTubeBlack] (https://www.youtube.com/intl/ALL_za/creators/ytbvoicesfund/ “information page about YouTube Black Voices”). 

(2) The website intends to provide a non-priced, contemporary way of distributing information by presenting non-literary approaches to accessing wellbeing content. Furthermore, Mintel reports have indicated that the growth of digital resources and platforms have encouraged people to engage with more visual content, specifically on digital devices like laptops and smartphones (McGrath, 2020).  Specifically, visual media (films, art, images etc.) has greater engagement from those aged people aged 16-44. Moreover, trend reports have also indicated that around 26% of UK adults are likely to engage in traditional reading (e.g. books) (Ryan, 2020). 

CWW intends to both bolster users’ exposure to content and resources that helps develop positive mindfulness practices which will likely promote overall wellbeing. A secondary initiative for the website is to expose users to influencers that curate content around this subject matter – wellbeing, with the African/Caribbean diaspora in mind.  

#### Competitors: How does CWW differs competitors and substitutes?

Based on my research, most wellbeing and mindfulness websites presents more of a clinical narrative in relation to the services and content they provide. For instance, sites such as [Rethink Mental Illness]( https://www.rethink.org/advice-and-information/living-with-mental-illness/wellbeing-physical-health/black-asian-and-minority-ethnic-mental-health/ “website link”) offer clinical services such as counselling and priced materials (e.g. meditation courses, books). While it is helpful, a Google search of the phrase ‘black wellbeing’ presented a list of wide range of articles and resources written in extremely formal tones. While this is appropriate for wellbeing issues, CWW intends to present resources with a more informal relaxed tone, reflecting websites such as [World Changer Life]( https://www.worldchangerlife.com/), [Kwanda]( https://kwanda.co/), [Black Zen](https://www.blackzen.co/#services-and-more) and [Black Women Healing Retreats]( https://www.blackwomenhealingretreats.com/about-black-women-healing-retreats.html).  

### 2.3 UX Design Wireframes, Mockups design documents

I have provided links to serval documents that have supported my conceptualisation and implementation of designing the CWW website below. The content ranges from wireframes, mood bards, visual inspiration for choosing colour themes for the website: 

#### Wireframes 
Below are links to the wireframes of the CWW website design. I have grouped the wireframes by page and devices as it is the website are intended to be responsive to different devices, hence screen sizes (incl. Desktop, mobile and tablet screens). 

1.	[Wireframe – HOME]( https://github.com/SOlaCoder005/coca-women-wellness/tree/master/docs/wireframes/home-pages "Wireframes for Home page") 
2.	[Wireframe – ABOUT]( https://github.com/SOlaCoder005/coca-women-wellness/tree/master/docs/wireframes/about-pages  "Wireframes for About page")
3.	[Wireframe – RECIPES]( https://github.com/SOlaCoder005/coca-women-wellness/tree/master/docs/wireframes/recipes-pages   "Wireframes for Recipes page")
4.	[Wireframe – PLAYLISTS]( https://github.com/SOlaCoder005/coca-women-wellness/tree/master/docs/wireframes/playlists-pages "Wireframes for Playlists page")
5.	[Wireframe – CONNECT]( https://github.com/SOlaCoder005/coca-women-wellness/tree/master/docs/wireframes/playlists-pages "Wireframes for Connect page")

##### Mockups 

### Moodboards and Diagrams

To help better visualise the final outcome of the CWW website, I chose to research some popular wellbeing websites that depict the common cultural characteristics within different communities of the African/Caribbean diaspora. Below are links to the moodboards and documents that helped to direct my design process and rationale behind the website: 

<img src="/docs/colour-theme/cww-website-colourtheme.png">

**Rationale:** Keeping cultural characteristics in mind, I chose to use a combination of brown and other warm hues. In more detail, the colour yellow has strong social-cultural ties as well as semantic and symbolic meaning within several African/Caribbean communities. Similarly, many of these cultures have assigned positive connotations to the colour yellow. For instance, concepts around wealth, femininity and fertility in some African cultures are often illustrated with yellow aspects, this can range from garment colour schemes and even religious characterisations. For instance, the Yoruba Orisha – Oshun has been often been drawn wearing yellow garments (Britannica.com, 2021).  Similarly, within the Caribbean, specifically Rastafarian cultures, the colour yellow has been included in their native attire and artefacts. Yellow in this culture is used to signify wealth and prosperity (BBC.co.uk, 2009).  

## Section 3: Features
    In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project and describe each in a sentence or so.

    Existing Features
    Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
    ...
    For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

    In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Section 5: JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Section 6: Testing
    In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

    Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

    For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

## Section 7: Contact form
    Go to the "Contact Us" page
    Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
    In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

    You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

    If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Section 8: Deployment

    This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

    In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

    Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
    Different configuration files?
    Separate git branch?
    In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
