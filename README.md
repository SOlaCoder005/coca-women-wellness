## 1. Overview

- This website is the product of the Portfolio Project 1: HTML & CSS Essentials (a.k.a. Milestone Project 1, MS1). 

- It is part of the Code Institutes’ (CI) Diploma in Full Stack Software Development Diploma (5P).

### 1.1 Chosen Project Idea 
- Out of several ideas presented, Project Idea 0 was chosen as the project asked to ‘…bring your own ideas to life…” through the creation of a website.

- To provide more conceptual structure to the project, the Coca Women Wellness (CWW) website uses the concepts presented in Project Idea Example 3 as a point of reference.  

### 1.2 Project Goals 


## 2. User Experience (UX)


### 2.1 User Stories (Strategy)

#### **2.1.1 Market climate**
Through market research, the following findings supported the conceptualisation of the Coca Women Wellness Website: 

- Due to ongoing sociocultural and social-economic inequality in multiple societies (e.g. COVID-19 and continued social inequality), there has been increased discourse on raising awareness around, and providing greater support for improving people’s wellbeing. 

- Further, there has been an increased volume of socio-economic initiatives that aim to bolster the mental, social, and emotional wellbeing of minority groups, particularly those in the African and/or Caribbean diaspora. 

Considering this, the CWW hosts primary and secondary wellbeing media and resources (e.g. images, videos, tutorials, influencers, and recipes) curated by, and for, communities of the African/Caribbean diaspora. 

#### **2.1.2 Essential Definitions – ‘Mindfulness’ and ‘Wellbeing’**

An essential step in the development of Coca Women Wellness was to understand the semantic meaning and differences between the terms ‘Mindfulness’ and ‘Wellbeing’. 

**Wellbeing**

While the terms _‘wellbeing’_  and  _‘mindfulness’_ are often used interchangeably. It is worth noting that wellbeing is considered a _‘… broad concept…relating to…personal dignity (including treatment of the individual with respect)…, physical and mental health and emotional wellbeing,.. social and economic wellbeing. To summarise, ‘…Wellbeing encompasses several areas of life.'.  As such, it is a growing consensus that _‘…using a holistic approach to ensure a clear understanding of the individual’s views is vital to identifying and defining wellbeing in each case.”_ (Hpft.nhs.uk., 2021).

**Mindfulness**

Similarly, mindfulness is characterised as _“…the practice of maintaining a non-judgmental state of heightened or complete awareness of one's thoughts, emotions, or experiences on a moment-to-moment basis.”_  (Merriam-Webster.com, 2021).

With these definitions in mind, rather than being interchangeable, wellbeing and mindfulness can be regarded as adjoining concepts, where developing mindful practices (in whatever area of life) is likely to positively impact overall wellbeing.

#### **2.1.3 Key Demographic(s)**

‘Demographics’ relates to the characteristics of a population and the specific groups within it. As such, the key demographic factors considered when choosing the target audience of the Coca Women Wellness website were:  

- Sex: Women 
- Age: 16-40
- Ethnicity: African and/or Caribbean heritage 

#### **2.1.4 Psychographics**

‘Psychographics’ refers to the common socio-psychological factors (e.g. motivations, priorities, perspectives etc.) that influences a person’s or groups’, beliefs, expectations, perspectives and hence behaviours.
Prior to creating the website, some market research was conducted to gain insight into the potential psychographic expectations of the target audience. 

The research specifically focused on their expectations when visiting sites that offer content and resources around mindfulness and/or wellbeing. As such, several women were asked the following questions:

1.	Do you visit any wellbeing sites/apps? If so could provide some names?

2.	Do you follow any black female wellbeing influencers?

3.	Do you think wellbeing content created by and for black women would help support your wellbeing?

4.	If you were looking at a wellbeing site designed to promote the wellbeing of black women - what type of content would you like to see? 

5.	How do you prefer wellbeing topics/content to be presented to you (e.g. via blogs, videos, images, courses, or books)?

|Q/User| User ‘R’| User ‘A’| User ‘L’| User ‘AM’| 
|-------------|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------
|Q1.|- “…Influencers: **kokobo fitness** - recommended by my sister but I don't know such black influencers myself.”| N/A| “…Emmm I normally go on **skin care** websites. Cleansers/lotions designed for the **black skin**…”|“No I haven’t visited any well-being apps recently.”|
|Q2.|“…Not ones specifically for black woman per se but I use the **Headspace app**.”|N/A|N/A|“Not specifically for well-being no.”|
|Q3.|“…Yeah, BW content could support my wellbeing but I haven't really looked for it.” |“…I think it would be the importance of vulnerability, and black women have it in is too.  I think **self concept** is vital too.” |N/A|“Yes it would be **encouraging** to see **other black women** who are passionate about looking after **their well-being**…”|
|Q4.|N/A|N/A|“… The content I would like to say is **skin care**, brightening creams/lotions. **Products** that make **chocolate skin glow**....**Healthy** vegetarian **meals**… Also more thing Samara, **hair** products for relaxed hair.”|- “I would like to see content relating to **emotional, physical and spiritual well-being**, basically **all aspects of life**”|
|Q5.|N/A|“Blogs and videos.”|N/A|“…books (audio books); videos; vlogs; blogs”|

In extension to the research, the principles outlined in the [‘strategy plane’](https://medium.com/designcentered/ux-design-5-planes-method-b1b1d6587c05#:~:text=The%20five%20planes%20%E2%80%94%20strategy%2C%20scope,the%20problem%20as%20a%20whole.), of the  5 Planes of UX Design model was referred to. This plane assisted in identifying the deliverables of the site. These deliverables were determined and valued by perceived importance, viability, and feasibility. This approached produced the following findings:

#### **2.1.5 User stories – A Summary** 

Based on the interpretations derived from the data, it can be argued that goals of first-time and reoccurring visitors as well as the site owner are as follows: 

**First-time visitor(s) goals**

When visiting the Coca Women Wellness site I want to: 

1. Be introduced to new ways of developing my wellbeing and mindfulness practices.

2. Engage with visual, auditory, and literary content that develops and positively addresses multiple facets of wellbeing.

3. Gain exposure to ‘other’ and new influencers who provide content on multiple topics relevant to promoting my wellbeing. Such facets include, but are not limited to;

    - Meditation practices
    - Platonic, familial, and romantic relationships/social interaction 
    - Hair and Skin care products/practices 
    - ‘Healthy’ food  

4. See the site present content that reflects topics relevant to my ethnicity and cultural background.

7. Engage in the Online and In-person meetups hosted by Coca Women Wellness.

8. Engage with the Coca Women Wellness online community (e.g. via discord and other social media channels).

Additionally, the interpretation of the data charts above the indicated the perceived priorities (goals) for the site owner: 

**Site owner goals**

As a site owner I want to:

9. Host and share resources that helps site visitors learn mindful, wellbeing and self-improvement techniques. 

10. Create a functional website where the user can navigate around easily and access content effortlessly. 

11. Provide resources that promotes wellbeing, particularly for women of the African and Caribbean diaspora.

12. Host and promote wellbeing and mindfulness content, particularly made by influencers of the African and Caribbean diaspora. 

13. Increase user interaction across social media platforms.

### 2.2 Website value (Scope)

The [‘scope plane’]( https://medium.com/designcentered/ux-design-5-planes-method-b1b1d6587c05#:~:text=The%20five%20planes%20%E2%80%94%20strategy%2C%20scope,the%20problem%20as%20a%20whole.), in the 5 Planes of UX Design model suggests that designers should focus on *‘what content may be required to meet users’ needs..’*.  

#### **2.2.1 Valuableness of the website** 

The Coca Women Wellness website provides serves several purposes which increases its value: 

1.  The site intends to bolster users’ wellbeing through exposing them to wellbeing influencers and resources primarily sourced from the African/Caribbean diaspora. 

2. Based on some excerpts from the users’ stories – several women had limited knowledge of wellbeing influencers, specifically those of African and/or Caribbean decent. Lack of exposure of such influencers in media has been a prevalent issue that is being addressed in the current social climate. It has led to the implementation of inclusion and diversity initiatives in media such as [#YouTubeBlack](https://www.youtube.com/intl/ALL_za/creators/ytbvoicesfund/). Coca women wellness attempts to address these issues though the nature of the site’s content. 

3.  The website provides a free, contemporary way of distributing information by presenting non-literary approaches to accessing wellbeing content. 
Mintel reports have indicated that the growth of digital resources and platforms have encouraged people to engage with more visual content, specifically on digital devices like laptops and smartphones (McGrath, 2020).  Moreover, visual content (e.g. films, art, images etc.) has greater engagement from those aged people aged 16-44. Such findings echo trend reports’ assertions that around 26% of UK adults are likely to engage in traditional reading (e.g. hardcover books) (Ryan, 2020). 

As such, the key initiatives of CWW are to: 

- Bolster users’ exposure to digital content and resources that helps develop positive mindfulness practices which will likely promote overall wellbeing. 

- Expose users to influencers that curate content around wellbeing, with the African/Caribbean diaspora in mind.  

#### **2.2.2 Competitors: How does CWW differs competitors?**

To determine the valuableness of the site, it was essential to analyse how the CWW differs from competitor sites. 

Arguably, a lot of wellbeing and mindfulness websites portray a clinical narrative which is often reflected in their content (e.g. aesthetical design) and services (e.g. therapeutic services and treatment). For instance, sites such as [Rethink Mental Illness]( https://www.rethink.org/advice-and-information/living-with-mental-illness/wellbeing-physical-health/black-asian-and-minority-ethnic-mental-health/) offer clinical services such as counselling and priced therapeutic materials (e.g. meditation courses, books). Moreover, a Google search of the phrase ‘black wellbeing’ presented a list of wide range of articles and resources written in extremely formal tones. 

While these resources are appropriate and invaluable to addressing and supporting matters around wellbeing, CWW has been designed with a more informal tone. Specifically, CWW hosts wellbeing resources in an informal relaxed way, reflecting websites such as: 

- [World Changer Life](https://www.worldchangerlife.com/)
- [Kwanda](https://kwanda.co/) 
- [Black Zen](https://www.blackzen.co/#services-and-more) 
- [Black Women Healing Retreats](https://www.blackwomenhealingretreats.com/about-black-women-healing-retreats.html).  


## 3. Content

In line with the [‘structure’ and ‘skeleton’ planes]( https://medium.com/designcentered/ux-design-5-planes-method-b1b1d6587c05#:~:text=The%20five%20planes%20%E2%80%94%20strategy%2C%20scope,the%20problem%20as%20a%20whole.) of the 5 Planes of UX Design model, producing the initial wireframes were key to the development of the site’s User Interface (UI).  

This section outlines several elements  that have supported the conceptualisation and implementation of designing the CWW website. The content in this section includes wireframes, mood boards and colour pallets, font selection and logo design.   
  

### 3.1. Wireframes (Structure and Skeleton)

The wireframes below depict the **preliminary structure** for the CWW website. These have been grouped by page and device type. 

![](docs/wireframes/desktopwireframespreview.png)

1.	[Wireframe – HOME]( https://github.com/SOlaCoder005/coca-women-wellness/tree/master/docs/wireframes/home-pages "Wireframes for Home page") 
2.	[Wireframe – ABOUT]( https://github.com/SOlaCoder005/coca-women-wellness/tree/master/docs/wireframes/about-pages  "Wireframes for About page")
3.	[Wireframe – RECIPES]( https://github.com/SOlaCoder005/coca-women-wellness/tree/master/docs/wireframes/recipes-pages   "Wireframes for Recipes page")
4.	[Wireframe – PLAYLISTS]( https://github.com/SOlaCoder005/coca-women-wellness/tree/master/docs/wireframes/playlists-pages "Wireframes for Playlists page")
5.	[Wireframe – CONNECT]( https://github.com/SOlaCoder005/coca-women-wellness/tree/master/docs/wireframes/playlists-pages "Wireframes for Connect page")

 - **PLEASE NOTE:** The structure and appearance of the live deployed CWW website differs considerably from the preliminary wireframes. These differences resulted from responsiveness issues that arose during the initial design of the CWW website. Further information around this has been documented in the [TESTING.md](https://github.com/SOlaCoder005/coca-women-wellness/blob/a5c2068f53f901115928df67ad9651ef0c35415e/docs/testing/TESTING.md) document within this repository’s directory.

Although the final structure of the site differs considerably to the preliminary wireframes; the live deployed CWW has greater responsiveness when accessed by different devices (incl. Desktop, mobile and tablet screens). 

### 3.2 User Experience Design (UXD) elements (Surface)

Akin to recommendations highlighted in the [‘surface’ plane](https://medium.com/designcentered/ux-design-5-planes-method-b1b1d6587c05#:~:text=The%20five%20planes%20%E2%80%94%20strategy%2C%20scope,the%20problem%20as%20a%20whole.) of the 5 Planes of UX Design model, the visual characteristics were finalised nearing the end of the site development. 

The following sections outline key visual elements that have supported the conceptualisation and implementation of designing the CWW website (incl. colour pallet choices, fonts and logo).

#### **3.2.1 [Colour Pallet](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/feli_fierce/cww_website_colourtheme/) Rationale** 

Keeping cultural characteristics in mind, a combination of brown and other warm hues were incorporated into the colour scheme CWW. For instance, the conscious decision to apply yellow as the primary colour scheme of the homepage was linked to the strong social-cultural, semantic, and symbolic meaning it conveys within several African/Caribbean communities. 

![](docs/colour-theme/cww-website-colourtheme.png)

Many of these cultures have assigned positive connotations to the colour yellow. For instance, concepts around wealth, femininity and fertility in some African cultures are often illustrated with yellow aspects, this can be incorporated into garment colour schemes and even religious characterisations. For instance, the Yoruba Orisha – Oshun has been often been drawn wearing yellow garments (Britannica.com, 2021).  Similarly, within the Caribbean, specifically Rastafarian cultures, the colour yellow has been included in their native attire and artefacts. Yellow in this culture is used to signify wealth and prosperity (BBC.co.uk, 2009).  

The other colours throughout the site were sourced from the images on the left-hand-side of the website’s pages (on desktop screen). Below is a list of the colours, with their respective HEX and RGB values: 

![](docs/colour-theme/colour-pallet-cww.png)

#### **3.2.2 Fonts** 

The fonts used on the CWW site were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and were used on the website for the following reasons: 

![](docs/colour-theme/font-cww.PNG)

1. **Oswald**: This is a considerably ‘weighted’ sans-serif font. It was used on the header sections to ensure that the navigation titles remained prominent across the varying header colours.

2. **Open Sans**: Aside from the header, this font was used throughout the site. It was chosen to compliment the ‘feminine’ theme of the site. Arguably, round shapes are often associated with feminine characteristics. As such, the rounded characteristics of this font conveys a softer tone to the overall page compared to the Oswald font and vibrant colours used. 

#### **3.2.3 Coca Women Wellness Logo** 

The logo for the site was created initial by hand and then illustrated through the following software:

- Adobe Illustrator
- Adobe Photoshop
- Adobe InDesign 

![](assets/images/website-screenshots-and-elements/logowithtext.png) 


The colour **#3E0D05** was applied to the logo illustration for two key reasons:

1. To maintain aesthetic continuity across the site’s element (e.g. majority of the site text, social media icons and some header titles). 

2. To reduce the risk of creating a harsh contrast between the background and foreground. For instance, typically, within deigns and visual content that aim to convey warning or alerts will tend to use a combination of bright yellow(s), white and black. As this is not the purpose of the CWW website, the use of the colour black was avoided.

## 4. Features

This section provides an overview of the features on the Coca Women Wellness website, and where relevant, the way in which the feature(s) address the user stories in prior sections.

## 6. Testing

A series of tests have been conducted on the CWW site’s functionality and its source-code. An extensive report of the tests conducted can be accessed [here](/docs/testing/TESTING.md); titled as ‘TESTING.md’. The report discusses the multiple factors that arose throughout the testing process of the site. The key points discussed in the report include:

- Responsiveness issues with CWW site’s initial design and structure (reflected in the wireframes). 

- Explanation of how the issues above contributed to the need to change CWW site’s structure and design.

- Methods undertaken to create and test the current CWW site’s structure and responsiveness. 

- User Stories testing process.

### 6.2 Fixed bugs

Aside from the testing discussed in the [‘TESTING.md’](/docs/testing/TESTING.md) report, two additional ‘bugs’ frequently arose throughout the development of the CWW site, until a solution was found. For instance:  

#### **6.2.1 Blurry images on the CWW’s pages**

- **Issue**: 

    While the photos used on the site were sourced from Pexels.com with a high resolution, the images were blurry on several web browsers and device screens.  

- **Solution**: 
    
    After conducting further research into image quality within coding, the issue was resolved by using the property **‘object-fix:___;’** as a function within the .css style sheet. 

#### **6.2.2 CWW's images failed to display on one web browser but not the other**

- **Issue**: 
    
    When using an android tablet, the images on CWW did not display on a Google Chrome browser but did on the Microsoft Edge browser. This issue persisted after clearing the cache and cookies data on the Google Chrome browser multiple times.  However, during this time, the images were displaying on Google Chrome browsers on android mobile devices (e.g. Oppo Reno Z) and Google Chrome’s desktop application. 

-  **Solution**: 
    
    The issue was resolved by manually resizing images’ dimensions (px) and reducing the resolution (dpi) values. This was achieved using Adobe Photoshop. Arguably, this method can cause issues when printing images, however as the images were to be displayed digitally, reducing the resolution of the images did not have a detrimental impact on the images’ aesthetics.  After resizing, the images showed on both browsers on tablet, mobile and desktop devices.
