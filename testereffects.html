                    <p>For some, gluten free food can help aid digestion and inflammation! With that in mind, these gluten free pancakes are a beautiful treat for anyone with a sweet tooth. At least we can feel less guilty about eating it as it is gluten free!</p>
                <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>250g gluten-free plain flour</li>
                        <p>¼ cup of coconut sugar (use any sugar/sweetener of your choice)</p>
                        <p>¼ tsp Xanthan gum (optional, depending on whether the flour has a raising agent in it already)</p>
                        <p>1 egg</p>
                        <p>250ml Almond milk (use any milk/sweetener of your choice)</p>
                        <p>Dairy free / gluten-free butter of your choice</p>
                        <p>Honey</p>
                        <p>Sliced strawberries (as much as you want as this is for the topping)</p>
                    </ul>
                <h4>Instructions</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Turn your oven hob on and let the frying pan heat up to a medium heat.</li>
                    <p>2. Mix the milk, sugar, and egg together until fully combined</p>
                    <p>3. Add the flour to the milk, egg, and sugar mixture. Mix well until fully combined.</p>
                    <p>4. Once the frying pan is hot, add some butter to the pan and let it spread around the pan base.</p>
                    <p>5. Add the pancake batter to the pan. Wait for the bottom of the pancake to brown and then flip. </p>
                    <p>6. Once both sides are brown, remove the pancake from the pan and place on the plate. </p>
                    <p>7. Repeat the process until the pancake batter has been used. Stack each pancake on top of each other.</p>
                    <p>8. Drizzle honey over the pancakes and add strawberries on top for extra flavour!</p>

                    <span><i class="far fa-clock"></i> 30-munites </span><span><i class="fas fa-utensils"></i> Serves 3 people</span>
                    <p>Sorrel juice is a traditional drink served in many areas of the world, particularly in the Caribbean! The leaves are consumable and has anti-inflammatory properties. It is also used to help treat bacterial infections. It’s great to add to herbal teas too!</p>
                <h4>Ingredients</h4> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 cup of dried Sorrel leaves</li>
                        <li>2 Oranges (Keep the rind, we will need this)</li>
                        <li>1 Cinnamon stick</li>
                        <li>1 Lemon</li>
                        <li>1 tsp of cloves</li>
                        <li>500ml of water</li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>Instructions</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Add water to a pot and place pot on the hob.</li>
                        <li>Wash the sorrel leaves and add to the pot.</li>
                        <li>Cut the lemon in half and squeeze some of the juice into the pot. The quantity is up to you, just remember lemon juice is bitter and too much can make the juice bitter tasting. </li>
                        <li>Peel some of the rind off the orange and add to the pot.</li>
                        <li>Squeeze all the juice of the orange into the pot.</li>
                        <li>Break the cinnamon stick into pieces and ad to the pot and add the cloves also. </li>
                        <li>Place the pot onto the oven hob and bring the pot to a rolling boil.</li>
                        <li>Once boiling, reduce the heat to a medium-low temperature. Add the lid to the pot and let the mixture simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
                        <li>After 30-minutes remove the pot from the pot and drain the juice through a strainer into another large bowl or container.</li>
                        <li>Allow the juice to fully cool down in this container and then store in the fridge. I like to transfer the juice to a glass bottle before putting it into the fridge.</li>

                <span><i class="far fa-clock"></i> 30-munites </span><span><i class="fas fa-utensils"></i> Serves 3 people</span>
                <p>Some of the key health benefits of ginger is that it can help lower blood sugar levels and aid indigestion. Similarly, cinnamon also has anti-inflammatory properties and can help to strengthen the body’s sensitivity to insulin! Besides the health benefits it tastes amazing and feels ‘yummy going into the tummy’.</p>
